Implement a Histogram equalization from scratch using C++. Input should be an Image and the output should be a Linear Filtered Image.

Histogram Equalisation
Histogram represents the number of pixels for each intensity value considered.
Histogram Equalisation is a computer image processing technique used to improve contrast in images. This can be done by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values. This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable data is represented by close contrast values. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast.

PACKAGES USED:
opencv2/highgui/highgui.hpp
C++ image display, sliders, mouse interaction, I/O
opencv2/imgproc/imgproc.hpp
C++ image processing functions
